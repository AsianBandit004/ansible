These are all static HTML websites I made using a combination of warp cli, ChatGPT, Anisble and creativity! Please feel free to copy and paste this into a text file and use the **ansible-playbook filename -K** command to deploy. This assumes you already have a client and server built with SSH capability for deployment.
