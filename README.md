# Ansible Beginnings

Hello! And welcome all to my first Github repo! 

I am excited to share with you little snips of code and things I am currently working on in my home lab using Proxmox and Ansible :)



# Program Jokes
# Tech News Daily
# Cyber Security tips

These are all static HTML websites I made using a combination of warp cli, ChatGPT, and creativity! Please feel free to copy and paste this into a text file and use the **ansible-playbook filename -K** command to deploy. This assumes you already have a client and server built with SSH capability for deployment.

# Update-Upgrade-All-Servers

Is a small playbook that checks your Ansible servers for any updates and if so updates and upgrades 

# Check-For-Apache2

Is also a small script that checks for the apache2 webserver and if not installed will let you know


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please feel free to use any of these scripts at your leisure and please give me feedback on improvements and recommendations
