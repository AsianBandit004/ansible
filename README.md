# Ansible Beginnings

Hello! And welcome all to my first Github repo! 

I am excited to share with you little snips of code and things I am currently working on in my home lab using Proxmox and Ansible :)

# Tech News Daily
# Cyber Security tips

These are all static HTML websites I made using a combination of warp cli, ChatGPT, and creativity! Please feel free to copy and paste this into a text file and use the **ansible-playbook filename -K** command to deploy. This assumes you already have a client and server built with SSH capability for deployment.

# Update-Upgrade-All-Servers

Is a small playbook that checks your Ansible servers for any updates and if so updates and upgrades 

# Check-For-Apache2

Is also a small script that checks for the apache2 webserver and if not installed will let you know

# Terraform

I was watching LearnLinuxTV and he had a really nice script to deploy and automate VM creation with Terraform. I added my own information and was able to spin up a VM in Proxmox with no manual intervention. That is after the template file is created, if you do not have a template file then you will need to do that first before trying Terraform script.

Please feel free to use any of these scripts at your leisure and please give me feedback on improvements and recommendations
