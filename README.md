# Ansible 

Hello! And welcome all to my first Github repo! 

I am excited to share with you little snips of code and things I am currently working on in my home lab using Proxmox and Ansible :)

These are all static HTML websites I made using a combo of warp cli, chatgpt, and creativity! Please feel free to copy and paste this into a text file and use; **ansible-playbook <filename> -K** command to deploy. This assumes you already have a client and server built out with SSH capability for deploying.

# Update/Upgrade

Is a small playbook that checks your Ansible servers for any updates and if so updates and upgrades 

# Apache2

Is also a small script that checks for the apache2 webserver and if not installed will install it for you



Please feel free to use any of these scripts at your leisure and please give me feedback on improvements and recommendations
